# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of
experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual
orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

- Showing empathy and kindness towards others.
- Respecting the opinions, ideas, and experiences of others.
- Providing and receiving constructive feedback with honesty and respect.
- Taking responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes and
  learning from the experience.
- Focusing on what is best not only for us as individuals but for the community
  as a whole.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- Use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
  advances.
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
- Public or private harassment.
- Publishing others' private information, such as physical or electronic
  addresses, without explicit permission.
- Any other conduct that is considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned with this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any
contributor for behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing the project include using an official project email address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. The definition of representation
of the project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the project team at [your email address]. All complaints
will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed
necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to
maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further
details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the project's leadership.
